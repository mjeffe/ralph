# TODO List of Items to Implement

This list is for humans! It is a reminder of ideas and tasks that need to be spec'ed

- Simplify both plan and build prompts
- Change RALPH_VERSION to something else.
    - Or else add semver versioning to ralphs process? but that would affect projects that use it.
- analyze current ralph implementation, think of it as a prototype, suggest what
  we would do to create a production version. What needs to be cleaned up, what
  would be a more appropriate programming language than bash, what should be
  modularized, etc.
- how can we reduce token usage. These iterations are expensive
- create vm to run ralph in. Review some of the other ralph projects that list these options
