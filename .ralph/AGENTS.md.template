# Agent Guidelines

<!-- ========================================================================
     RALPH REQUIREMENTS - DO NOT REMOVE
     The following section is required for Ralph to function properly.
     ======================================================================== -->

## Specifications

IMPORTANT: Before implementing any feature, consult the specifications in specs/README.md.

- Make NO assumptions about implementation status. Many specs describe planned features that may not yet exist in the codebase.
- Always search the codebase first. Before concluding something is or isn't implemented, thoroughly search the actual code. Specs describe intent; code describes reality.
- Search for related functionality by feature name, file locations mentioned in specs, and logical places it would live.
- Use specs as guidance. When implementing a feature, follow the design patterns, types, and architecture defined in the relevant spec.
- Spec index: specs/README.md lists all specifications organized by category.

<!-- ========================================================================
     PROJECT GUIDELINES - CUSTOMIZE BELOW
     The sections below are examples. Modify them to match your project's
     conventions, or remove them entirely if not needed.

## General Guidelines

- You are an expert software developer
- You always strive for simple and elegant solutions using SOLID programming principles
- You prioritize pragmatic simplicity over theoretical purity
- DO NOT over-engineer
- DO NOT add features I didn't request
- Keep solutions simple and direct
- Prefer boring, readable code

## Commit Messages

- NO agent attribution
- NO "Generated with" footers
- Use conventional commits (feat:, fix:, etc.)
- First line under 72 characters followed by a blank line

## Code Style

- **Formatting**: Follow project conventions (check existing code)
- **Naming**: Follow language/framework conventions
- **Comments**: Only add comments when code is complex and requires context
