Summary: All specifications implemented and tested.

## Implemented Specifications

### System Specifications
- ralph-system-implementation.md - Complete Ralph build loop system with iterative development, fresh context per iteration, file-based state persistence, and git integration
- ralph-overview.md - Quick reference guide for agents working within Ralph
- ralph-portable-integration.md - Transformed Ralph into portable development tool installable via curl/wget into any project

### Feature Specifications  
- test-simple-calculator.md - Validated Ralph loop functionality by implementing calculator in test project
- docker-env-implementation-plan.md - Automatic .env configuration for cline CLI in Docker
- docker-configuration-fix-plan.md - Fixed Docker path mismatches and permissions

## Key Achievements

### Portability (ralph-portable-integration.md)
- All Ralph files organized under .ralph/ (except specs/)
- Created curl-able install.sh script for easy installation
- Implemented `ralph init` command for project setup
- Created AGENTS.md template with required ## Specifications section
- Removed all project-specific assumptions
- Comprehensive documentation in .ralph/docs/
- Successfully tested in fresh project (/tmp/ralph-test-project)

### Core System Features
- Autonomous build loop with fresh context per iteration
- File-based state management (IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md, PROGRESS.md)
- Git integration with automatic commits and pushes
- Health checks and validation hooks
- Comprehensive logging with metrics tracking
- Signal handling (Ctrl-C graceful shutdown)
- PROJECT_COMPLETE auto-detection and reset

### Docker Environment
- Automatic cline authentication on container startup
- Environment variable configuration via .env file
- Fixed path mismatches and permission issues
- Working development environment ready to use

## Validation Results

All specifications have been:
- ✅ Fully implemented
- ✅ Tested and verified working
- ✅ Documented in specs/README.md
- ✅ Tracked in PROGRESS.md with commit hashes

Ralph is now production-ready as a portable development tool that can be installed into any project to provide autonomous, iterative development with LLM agents.
