# Ralph Validation Hook - Example Template
#
# This is an optional validation script that runs after each iteration
# in build mode. Copy this file to .ralph/validate.sh and customize it
# for your project's needs.
#
# Exit code 0 = validation passed, loop continues
# Exit code non-zero = FATAL error, loop stops immediately
#
# Note: The agent is responsible for running and fixing its own tests
# during implementation. This validation is a final quality gate before
# continuing to the next iteration.

set -e  # Exit on any error
