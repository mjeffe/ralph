## Coding Agents

I have invested several months in working with Cline in VSCode and I'd like to stick with it if possible.
However, I have done a bit of searching and found this list of possible free/OSS alternatives to Claude Code.
- [Cline](https://docs.cline.bot/introduction/welcome)
- [Roo](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code?ref=ghuntley.com) - a fork of Cline
- [Crush](https://github.com/charmbracelet/crush)
- [Qwen Code](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code)
- []()

I should probably just pay the price and go with the 800lb Gorilla
